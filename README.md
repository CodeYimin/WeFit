Made in 24 hours at YRHacks.

# Functionalities

- Share: Automatically share your completed workouts. People you have friended can view your workouts on their feed. There's a fully functioning friends system.

# Problems solved: 
- Forgetting your workout
- Not tracking your workouts because it requires too many extra steps and effort
- Low workout motivation

# How problems are being solved
- By spending a couple minutes creating your workout program beforehand, the tracker will show you exactly what part of the workout you are and what exercise to do, making it impossible to forget your workout
- The tracker automatically logs the time you took on each exercise, as well as the reps and weight (you can set reps/weight after each exercise if it does not match the reps/weight described in the premade workout program)
- By seeing your friends workout, you are inclined to workout as well
